This is a work in progress website about open source hardware

Stack (roughly):
- Back end
  - Nginx
  - Node.js with express
  - dust.js (server side html rendering)
  - MariaDB, accessed using the mysql module
- Front end
  - A tiny bit of jQuery
  - WebGL for 3D model rendering

The project is on hold for now, our time is focused on other projects
